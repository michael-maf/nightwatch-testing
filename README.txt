Testing environment for windows environment.

-selenium standalone server 2.45.0
-nightwatch
-selenium webdriver

to run on windows: from /nightwatch, node nightwatch.js -t tests/webdriver_test.js (or any other test you prefer)
chrome and IE drivers must be added to PATH before running webdriver

for some reason, both are really slow.

also read IE fix note.
